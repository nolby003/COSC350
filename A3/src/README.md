## About the game 

In the Saboteur game, players are divided into two groups: the "Gold-Diggers" and the "Saboteurs." The goal of the Gold-Diggers is to reach the gold treasure by constructing a continuous path from the entrance card to the gold card. On the other hand, the Saboteurs aim to hinder the Gold-Diggers' progress and prevent them from reaching the treasure (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saboteur_(card_game)).
At the beginning of the game, the roles of the players are hidden from each other. Each player can play a tunnel card from their hand during their turn to extend the path. Additionally, players have action cards at their disposal that can help or disrupt the path construction.
Players take turns playing their cards and can use action cards to manipulate the game. The game ends when either the Gold-Diggers successfully reach the gold card or there are no more legal moves (e.g. when all the players and the deck runs out of playable cards). After the game ends, the true roles of all players are revealed, and points are awarded accordingly.
