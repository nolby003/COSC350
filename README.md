### These programs are built in Python using PyGame and some AI algorithms to create robotic (NPC) like movements and actions.

This project was developed as part of my University course Artificial Intelligence (COSC350) for my degree in BcompSci.

The programs consist of: 
* a Vacuum cleaner
* Tic Tac Toe
* The card game Saboteur - still a WIP to perfect the AI.
