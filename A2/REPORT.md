## Complexity of the Problem 

Provide an analysis of the complexity of the considered problem. You may use practical examples and/or data you collected while implementing the solution to this problem (e.g. computing times, memory size, etc.). **You can delete this paragraph in your submission**.

As with all skeleton code problems, learning how it all goes together and works is
always complex in itself, the complexity of solving this problem is always initially understanding the makeup of the
program prior to implementing all the missing functions.
Looking back at the environment files helps to understand how values are used and how the programs talks back.

## AI Techniques Considered

Discuss the AI techniques you considered to solve the problem. Explain which techniques you ultimately chose to implement and justify how your selection offers a good tradeoff between agent performance and computational speed. If you tested different solutions, you can mention the tests you performed to inform your final selection. **You can delete this paragraph in your submission**.

After I had implemented most of the requirements, the most difficult was implementing the intelligent behaviours
by finding the most suitable alogrithm to use, I had an issue trying to pass the minimax algo to the function after several
iterations so I decided to go with the Monte Carlo (MCTS) algo which seemed to work quite well without error.

## Reflections

Describe the challenges you encountered during the problem-solving and implementation processes and outline how you tackled or attempted to overcome them. **You can delete this paragraph in your submission**.

I spent many days trying to solve the legal moves implementation given how...
